## Logging Issues

All issues should be created using the [new issue form](https://github.com/belsrc/vue-gen/issues/new). If possible, use the [issue template](.github\ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the template into a new issue, delete the prerequisite section after reading, and fill in the appropriate information.

Project uses:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure code consistency.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) (via [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)) to ensure commit message consistency.
- [Yorkie](https://github.com/yyx990803/yorkie) to enforce both of the above with Git hooks.

_Issues that are cosmetic in nature and do not effect anything substantial will generally not be considered._
